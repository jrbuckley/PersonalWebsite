    React has become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. In this post, we'll explore the fundamentals of React and learn how to create your first component.
  </p>

  <h2>What is React?</h2>
  <p>
    React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer and allows you to create reusable UI components.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Components:</strong> The building blocks of any React application</li>
    <li><strong>Props:</strong> A way to pass data between components</li>
    <li><strong>State:</strong> Internal data that can change over time</li>
    <li><strong>Hooks:</strong> Functions that let you use state and other React features</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Creating Your First Component</h2>
  <p>
    Let's create a simple button component to demonstrate the basics:
  </p>

  <CodeExample code={buttonExample} />

  <h2>Using the Component</h2>
  <p>
    Here's how you would use the button component in your application:
  </p>

  <CodeExample code={appExample} />

  <h2>Next Steps</h2>
  <p>
    Now that you understand the basics, you can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Learn about React Hooks</li>
    <li>Explore state management</li>
    <li>Study component lifecycle</li>
    <li>Practice building more complex components</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Remember, React is all about components and reusability. The more you practice, the better you'll become at building efficient and maintainable applications.
