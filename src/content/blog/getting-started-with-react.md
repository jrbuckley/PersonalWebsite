# Getting Started with React

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this post, we'll explore the fundamentals of React and learn how to create your first component.

## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components."

## Key Concepts

### Components
Components are the building blocks of any React application. They are reusable pieces of UI that can be composed together to create complex interfaces.

### Props
Props are a way of passing data from parent to child components. They are read-only and help make components more reusable.

### State
State is used to manage data that can change over time. React provides hooks like `useState` to manage component state.

### Hooks
Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

## Creating Your First Component

Let's create a simple button component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Button({ text, onClick }) {
  return (
    <button 
      onClick={onClick}
      className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded"
    >
      {text}
    </button>
  );
}

export default Button;
```

To use this component in your application:

```jsx
import Button from './Button';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button 
        text="Click me!" 
        onClick={() => alert('Button clicked!')} 
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics, here are some topics to explore next:

1. React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
2. Component Lifecycle
3. React Router for navigation
4. State Management (Redux, Context API)
5. Testing React Components

Remember, practice makes perfect! Try building small components and gradually work your way up to more complex applications.
