# Getting Started with React

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this guide, we'll explore the fundamentals of React and how to get started with your first React application.

## What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components."

## Key Concepts

### Components
Components are the building blocks of any React application. They are reusable pieces of UI that can be composed together to create complex interfaces.

### Props
Props are a way of passing data from parent to child components. They are read-only and help maintain the unidirectional data flow in React applications.

### State
State is used to manage data that can change over time. React provides hooks like `useState` to manage component state.

### Hooks
Hooks are functions that allow you to "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

## Creating Your First Component

Let's create a simple button component to demonstrate these concepts:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Button({ label, onClick }) {
  const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false);

  return (
    <button
      className={`px-4 py-2 rounded-lg transition-colors ${
        isHovered ? 'bg-blue-600' : 'bg-blue-500'
      } text-white`}
      onClick={onClick}
      onMouseEnter={() => setIsHovered(true)}
      onMouseLeave={() => setIsHovered(false)}
    >
      {label}
    </button>
  );
}

export default Button;
```

## Using the Component

Here's how you would use the button component in your application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Button from './Button';

function App() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    alert('Button clicked!');
  };

  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">My React App</h1>
      <Button label="Click me!" onClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have a basic understanding of React, here are some next steps to continue your learning:

1. Learn about React Router for navigation
2. Explore state management solutions like Redux or Context API
3. Study React's lifecycle methods and hooks
4. Practice building more complex components
5. Learn about testing React applications

Remember, React is a vast ecosystem, and there's always more to learn. Start with these basics and gradually build your knowledge as you create more complex applications.
